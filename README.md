The main objective of our website is to provide a online survey system to people, so that they can do surveys with people across the world by sitting in their place itself.<br><br>
***Origin of the proposal***<br>
Web surveys are often faster, simpler and cheaper. This attracts a lot of people to do online surveys. Online surveys are becoming an essential research tool for a variety of research fields, as a result the existing online survey websites like GoogleForms, SurveyMonkey, TypeForm etc. are becoming more and more popular day by day as the need increases. Our website is inspired from many of the popular survey websites. We made research about the problems existing in current online survey websites and based on the reviews we have made our website in such a way that it will be simpler to use as compared to remaining websites.
